Feature:
  As a logged-in user
  I should be able to access my informations

  Background:
    Given the following fixtures are loaded:
      | LoadClientData        |
      | LoadOAuthTokenData    |

  Scenario: As a non logged-in user I cannot get my informations
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/me"
    Then the response status code should be 401

  Scenario: As a logged-in user I can get my informations with additional informations based on granted scope
    Given I am logged with "carl999@example.fr" via OAuth client "JeMarche App" with scope "jemarche_app"
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/me"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """

  Scenario: As a logged-in device I can get my informations with additional informations based on granted scope
